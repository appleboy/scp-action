SSH Proxy Setting:

- proxy_host - proxy host

## Setting up a SSH Key

Make sure to follow the below steps while creating SSH Keys and using them.
The best practice is create the SSH Keys on local machine not remote machine.
Login with username specified in Github Secrets. Generate a RSA Key-Pair:

```bash
# rsa
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

# ed25519
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 200 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Add newly generated key into Authorized keys. Read more about authorized keys [here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/authorized_keys/).

```bash
# rsa
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh b@B 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

# d25519
cat .ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh b@B 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
```

Copy Private Key content and paste in Github Secrets.

```bash
# rsa
clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# ed25519
clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

See the detail information about [SSH login without password](http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html).

**A note** from one of our readers: Depending on your version of SSH you might also have to do the following changes:

- Put the public key in `.ssh/authorized_keys2`
- Change the permissions of `.ssh` to 700
- Change the permissions of `.ssh/authorized_keys2` to 640

### If you are using OpenSSH

If you are currently using OpenSSH and are getting the following error:

```bash
ssh: handshake failed: ssh: unable to authenticate, attempted methods [none publickey]
```

Make sure that your key algorithm of choice is supported.
On Ubuntu 20.04 or later you must explicitly allow the use of the ssh-rsa algorithm. Add the following line to your OpenSSH daemon file (which is either `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` or a drop-in file under `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/`):

```bash
CASignatureAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
```

Alternatively, `ed25519` keys are accepted by default in OpenSSH. You could use this instead of rsa if needed:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 200 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

## Example

Copy file via a SSH password:

```yaml
- name: copy file via ssh password
  uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.7
  with:
    host: example.com
    username: foo
    password: bar
    port: 22
    source: "tests/a.txt,tests/b.txt"
    target: your_server_target_folder_path
```

Using the environment variables

```yaml
- name: copy file via ssh password
  uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.7
  with:
    host: ${{ env.HOST }}
    username: ${{ env.USERNAME }}
    password: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }}
    port: ${{ env.PORT }}
    source: "tests/a.txt,tests/b.txt"
    target: ${{ env.TARGET_PATH }}
```

Copy file via a SSH key:

```yaml
- name: copy file via ssh key
  uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.7
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
    username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
    port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}
    key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}
    source: "tests/a.txt,tests/b.txt"
    target: your_server_target_folder_path
```

Example configuration for ignore list:

```yaml
- name: copy file via ssh key
  uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.7
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
    username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
    port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}
    key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}
    source: "tests/*.txt,!tests/a.txt"
    target: your_server_target_folder_path
```

Example configuration for multiple servers:

```diff
  uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.7
  with:
-   host: "example.com"
+   host: "foo.com,bar.com"
    username: foo
    password: bar
    port: 22
    source: "tests/a.txt,tests/b.txt"
    target: your_server_target_folder_path
```

Example configuration for exclude custom files:

```yaml
  uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.7
  with:
    host: "example.com"
    username: foo
    password: bar
    port: 22
-   source: "tests/*.txt"
+   source: "tests/*.txt,!tests/a.txt,!tests/b.txt"
    target: your_server_target_folder_path
```

Upload artifact files to remote server:

```yaml
deploy:
  name: deploy artifact
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - run: echo hello > world.txt

    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: my-artifact
        path: world.txt

    - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: my-artifact
        path: distfiles

    - name: copy file to server
      uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.7
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
        username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
        key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}
        port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}
        source: distfiles/*
        target: your_server_target_folder_path
```

Remove the specified number of leading path elements:

```yaml
- name: remove the specified number of leading path elements
  uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.7
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
    username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
    key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}
    port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}
    source: "tests/a.txt,tests/b.txt"
    target: your_server_target_folder_path
    strip_components: 1
```

Old target structure:

```sh
foobar
  â””â”€â”€ tests
    â”œâ”€â”€ a.txt
    â””â”€â”€ b.txt
```

New target structure:

```sh
foobar
  â”œâ”€â”€ a.txt
  â””â”€â”€ b.txt
```

Only copy files that are newer than the corresponding destination files:

```yaml
changes:
  name: test changed-files
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Get changed files
      id: changed-files
      uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v35
      with:
        since_last_remote_commit: true
        separator: ","

    - name: copy file to server
      uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.7
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
        username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
        key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}
        port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}
        source: ${{ steps.changed-files.outputs.all_changed_files }}
        target: your_server_target_folder_path
```

Protecting a Private Key. The purpose of the passphrase is usually to encrypt the private key. This makes the key file by itself useless to an attacker. It is not uncommon for files to leak from backups or decommissioned hardware, and hackers commonly exfiltrate files from compromised systems.

```diff
  - name: ssh key with passphrase
    uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.7
    with:
      host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
      username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
      key: ${{ secrets.SSH2 }}
+     passphrase: ${{ secrets.PASSPHRASE }}
      port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}
      source: "tests/a.txt,tests/b.txt"
      target: your_server_target_folder_path
```

When copying files from a Linux runner to a Windows server, you should:

1. Download git for Windows
2. Change the default OpenSSH shell to git bach with the following powershell command.
3. Set `tar_dereference` and `rm` variable to `true` in the YAML file
4. Avoid putting the `port` value through a variable
5. Convert the target path to a Unix path: `/c/path/to/target/`

Change the default OpenSSH shell to git bach with the following powershell command.

```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\OpenSSH" -Name DefaultShell -Value "$env:Programfiles\Git\bin\bash.exe" -PropertyType String -Force
```

Convert the target path to a Unix path: `/c/path/to/target/`

```diff
  - name: Copy to Windows
      uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.7
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
        username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
        key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
        port: 22
        source: 'your_source_path'
-       target: 'C:\path\to\target'
+       target: '/c/path/to/target/'
+       tar_dereference: true
+       rm: true
```
